Cobbler 2.4.9 is now officially available!

This release works around the DNS issues we are having with the cobblerd.org domain.
We have moved back to using hosted files on GitHub URLs.

If you are using online features like <code>get-loaders</code> and <code>signature update</code> you will have
to upgrade to this release!

Bugfixes:

- Fix for a yaml.parser.ParserError in cobbler-web
