<p>As you have probably noticed by now, Cobbler has a new domain name. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/blog/1452-new-github-pages-domain-github-io">recently announced</a> that they were moving pages to the .io domain. While I understand their reasoning, I'm not a fan of the new domain so I figured it was time to make the move to a dedicated domain.</p>

<p>This was a fairly painless process and is hopefully transparent for all users, but if anyone has any issues please let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks and enjoy the new site!</p>
