<p>A quick highlight of the changes in this release:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple security fixes:

<ul>
<li>CSRF support for the web GUI, which will now default to using https too.</li>
<li>Power management subsystem completely re-worked to prevent command-injection (<a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2395">CVE-2012-2395</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for bind in chroot'd environments.</li>
<li>Koan now uses virt-install CLI instead of directly accessing the virtinst API</li>
<li>Various improvements for SuSE and autoyast, especially for PPC64-based systems.</li>
<li>BETA support for ESXi5 and gPXE</li>
<li>BETA support for using other template languages, like jinja2</li>
</ul>


<p>And of course tons of bug fixes.</p>

<p>Now that this release is out, and things have settled down from the change in leadership, expect much more frequent minor updates to address bugs much sooner. We will also be focusing on documentation now, especially since many of the features above are not documented well (or at all). Thanks to everyone who helped out with this release!</p>
