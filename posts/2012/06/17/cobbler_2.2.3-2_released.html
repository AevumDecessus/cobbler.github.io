<p>Minor release update to correct the DHCP config writing issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>[BUGFIX] re-enable writing of DHCP entries for non-pxeboot-enabled systems unless they're static</li>
</ul>


<p>I applied the fix suggested in that thread, so now dhcpd.conf entries will not be written if netboot-enabled is False and the interface is configured as static.</p>

<p>I'm starting to roll this out to Fedora now, so they should be in testing before long. This will replace the -1 release, which will never make it out of testing.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
