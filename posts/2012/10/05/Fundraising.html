<p>As cloud infrastructures (specifically Infrastructure as a Service platforms) become more commonplace, Cobbler will need to be adapted to provide the same flexibility in image management as it does for bare-metal. The main challenge to adding these features to date has been a lack of hardware for testing.</p>

<p>To overcome this, I have <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/cobbler24">launched an Indiegogo campaign</a> to raise money for the project.</p>

<p>In addition to hardware for adding IaaS platform features, I also plan to use a dedicated server for running continuous integration testing via Jenkins. Right now, all development and testing takes place on a single server running a handful of VM's, so it's quite limiting performance-wise. Having a dedicated system that also automatically runs tests whenever commits are made will greatly speed up the development and release time.</p>

<p>So, please spread the word and help to make Cobbler better!</p>
