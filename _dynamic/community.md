# Connecting to the Cobbler Community

There are many ways to connect to the Cobbler community, for both regular users and developers. 

## Mailing List

The primary mailing list for Cobbler is [cobbler@lists.fedorahosted.org](https://fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/cobbler).

Development questions/code should be sent here: [cobbler-devel@lists.fedorahosted.org](https://fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/cobbler-devel). If you're sending patches for review, please be sure to read the "Developer Documentation" section of the manual first.

## Github

The site menu has links to the github.com source and issues lists. If you have an issue, open a ticket so we can take care of it! The wiki is being migrated to the manuals, and will be deprecated in the future in favor of the documentation on this site.

## IRC Channels

You must join the mailing lists above in order to use them. If that's not your cup of tea, Cobbler has two IRC channels on Freenode:

<pre>
#cobbler
#cobbler-devel
</pre>

The devel channel is very lightly used currently (mainly reserved for highly technical code discussions), so it's best to start in #cobbler if you have questions, comments, or problems.

## Twitter

We use the twitter account [@cobblerproject](http://twitter.com/#!/cobblerproject) to post notifications of new versions and other relevant information.
