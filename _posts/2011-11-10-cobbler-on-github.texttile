Cobbler's now on github!   

Please use the issue tracker for all issues, and fork the project and use pull requests for contributing code.
This documentation site is *itself* on github, so you can submit patches here as well.  We'll continue to use
the fedorahosted.org mailing lists for project coordination, though we are otherwise discontinuing usage of Trac.
