Basically Scott Henson and I thought this would make it a lot easier to collaborate with everyone, and also this would help
increase our upstream we-accept-everyone's-contributions kind of focus.   A huge thanks to Fedora for hosting us for all
of these years.

Please use the issue tracker for all issues, and fork the project and use pull requests for contributing code.
This documentation site is *itself* on github, so you can submit patches here as well.  We'll continue to use
the fedorahosted.org mailing lists for project coordination, though we are otherwise discontinuing usage of Trac.
