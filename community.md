# Connecting to the Cobbler Community

There are many ways to connect to the Cobbler community, for both regular users and developers. 

## Mailing List

The primary mailing list for Cobbler is [cobbler-users@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cobbler-users).

## GitHub

The site menu has links to the [github.com](https://github.com/cobbler/) source. If you have a problem,
[open an issue](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/new/choose), so we can take care of it! The
[Wiki](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/wiki) is for developers who would like to help.

## Gitter

The probably most active chat is Gitter. You can find us there under:
[cobbler/community](https://gitter.im/cobbler/community)

Badge: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/cobbler/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/cobbler/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

## IRC Channels

You must join the mailing lists above in order to use them. If that's not your cup of tea, Cobbler has two IRC channels
on Freenode: `#cobbler` and `#cobbler-devel`.

The devel channel is very lightly used currently (mainly reserved for highly technical code discussions), so it's best
to start in #cobbler if you have questions, comments, or problems.

## Twitter

We use the Twitter account [@cobblerproject](http://twitter.com/#!/cobblerproject) to post notifications of new versions
and other relevant information.
