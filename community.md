# Connecting to the Cobbler Community

There are many ways to connect to the Cobbler community, for both regular users and developers. 

## Mailing List

The primary mailing list for Cobbler is [cobbler-users@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cobbler-users).

## Github

The site menu has links to the github.com source and issues lists. If you have an issue, open a ticket so we can take
care of it! The wiki is being migrated to the manuals, and will be deprecated in the future in favor of the
documentation on this site.

## Gitter

The probably most active chat is Gitter. You can find us there under:
[cobbler/community](https://gitter.im/cobbler/community)

Badge: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/cobbler/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/cobbler/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

## IRC Channels

You must join the mailing lists above in order to use them. If that's not your cup of tea, Cobbler has two IRC channels on Freenode:

- \#cobbler
- \#cobbler-devel

The devel channel is very lightly used currently (mainly reserved for highly technical code discussions), so it's best
to start in #cobbler if you have questions, comments, or problems.

## Twitter

We use the twitter account [@cobblerproject](http://twitter.com/#!/cobblerproject) to post notifications of new versions and other relevant information.
