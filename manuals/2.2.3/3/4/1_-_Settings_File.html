<p>The main settings file for cobbler is /etc/cobbler/settings. This file is YAML-formatted, so take care when hand-editing this file as an invalid formatting can render both the command-line utility and cobblerd inoperable.</p>

<p>Currently, if you make any changes to this file, you must restart cobblerd for them to take effect.</p>
