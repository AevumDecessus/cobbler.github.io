<h3>Bugfixes</h3>

<p>Seriously way too many to list individually. Read the change log, there were almost 1000 commits since the last release!</p>

<h3>Upgrade notes</h3>

<p>Before upgrading be sure to make a backup of /etc/cobbler and /var/lib/cobbler, this is where all your data resides. As some things have changed, read these notes before you get into reading about all the new features.</p>

<ul>
<li>Review/modify the /etc/cobbler/modules.conf.rpmnew file to include your site specific settings. Then move the new file into place.</li>
<li>Review/modify the /etc/httpd/conf.d/cobbler_web.conf.rpmnew file and move it into place.</li>
<li>Remove mod_python and install the mod_wsgi package</li>
<li>Uncomment the LoadModule command in /etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi.conf</li>
<li>Change <code>$kickstart_start</code> / <code>$kickstart_done</code> to <code>$SNIPPET('kickstart_start')</code> / <code>$SNIPPET('kickstart_done')</code> in the default kickstart template.</li>
<li>The buildiso subcommand now wants a space (instead of a comma) delimited list (eg. cobbler buildiso --systems="sys1 sys2 sys3")</li>
</ul>


<p>Internal changes:
- The "subnet" field has been renamed to "netmask". You might want to review your kickstarts/templates
- The "bonding" &amp; "bond_master" interface types are deprecated and replaced by new fields: "interface_type" &amp; "interface_master"</p>

<p>By loading and saving system objects any old fields/values will be translated to the new fields/values.
As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask the mailing list or hop on #cobbler on irc.freenode.net -- that's what we are there for!</p>
