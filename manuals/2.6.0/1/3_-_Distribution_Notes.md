Cobbler was originally written to support Fedora, Red Hat, and derivative distributions such as CentOS or
Scientific Linux. Cobbler now works for managing other environments, including mixed environments, occasionally with
some limitations. Debian and SuSE support is quite strong, with patches coming in from developers working on those
distributions as well.

However, in some cases (especially for newer distribution versions), a little extra work may be required after an import
in order to make things work smoothly.>
